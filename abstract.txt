SanathanAI is an AI-driven spiritual assistant designed to provide intelligent,
respectful answers grounded in the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma, including the Vedas,
Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and other Hindu texts. Leveraging natural language
processing (NLP),large language models (LLMs), and semantic search via vector embeddings,
SanathanAI allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive contextually
relevant responses. It aims to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and modern 
technology by offering a scalable, interactive, and scripturally accurate experience.

Tools & Technologies Required

1. Programming Languages:

Python (core logic and backend development)

2. Frameworks:

FastAPI ‚Äì lightweight backend for serving APIs

3. Django ‚Äì for admin panel or web UI (optional)

4. Natural Language Processing & AI:

OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4) or open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon)


5. Vector Databases:

FAISS ‚Äì open-source and local, good for prototyping


6. Data & Text Processing:

PDF/Text parsers (e.g., PyMuPDF or pdfplumber)

7. Frontend/UI (optional):

React.js, Streamlit, or Django templates

üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Build the Project

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Collect digitized scriptures (in English/Sanskrit, preferably translated and categorized).

Clean and segment the text by verse, chapter, or paragraph.

Preprocess text (remove unwanted symbols, normalize, tokenize).

2. Embedding Generation

Use an embedding model (like sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert text chunks into vector representations.

Store these vectors in a vector database (FAISS or Pinecone) with metadata (scripture name, chapter, verse number).

3. Build Retrieval System

On user query, convert the question to an embedding.

Search for top-k similar chunks using vector similarity.

Retrieve top relevant passages to provide context for the LLM.

4. Integrate with LLM (QA Pipeline)

Feed the retrieved context + user query to an LLM (OpenAI GPT or local model like Mistral using Transformers).

Use prompt engineering to ensure respectful and accurate responses (e.g., ‚ÄúAnswer based only on the following texts‚Ä¶‚Äù).

Apply safeguards for hallucination or inappropriate content.

5. Backend Development

Create APIs using FastAPI to handle:

Query input

Retrieval and response generation

Logging and monitoring

6. Web Interface (optional)

Build a simple front-end to let users interact with the assistant.

Chat interface (React, Streamlit, or Django)

Display retrieved scripture references for transparency

7. Optional Features

Multilingual support (Hindi, Tamil, Sanskrit)

Voice input/output (Speech-to-text and text-to-speech)

Admin dashboard for adding/editing scriptural content

User feedback mechanism for quality improvement

8. Testing & Deployment

Test for accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and factual grounding.

Deploy using platforms like Render, Heroku, or AWS EC2.

Add rate-limiting, authentication (if needed), and logging.

‚úÖ Final Outcome

A web or API-based assistant that allows users to:

Ask spiritual and philosophical questions

Receive responses supported by exact scripture references

Explore the richness of Sanatana Dharma in a guided and respectful manner



What is sentence-transformers?

It‚Äôs a Python library that provides easy access to
pre-trained models that can convert sentences,
paragraphs, or documents into dense vector embeddings
(numerical representations).
